# Collaboratively Designing Metrics to Evalute Creative Machines

### Sunday, October 18

### 15:00pm - 19:00pm (Montreal Time, GMT-4, EST)

How do we make a creative machine? Creativity involves “a multitude of definitions, conceptualizations, domains, disciplines that bear on its study, empirical methods, and levels of analysis, as well as research orientations that are both basic and applied - and applied in varied contexts.” This workshop follows a series of studies conducted in the classroom setting at CMU and UC San Diego. To begin, participants were asked to provide a definition of creativity specific to machines. Then more questions emerged: Can we computationally model ambiguity? Would a novelty search result in valuable discoveries? Where is the threshold between randomness and creativity? How do we evaluate the creativity of an algorithm? To answer these questions, participants developed sets of criteria to assess their own and peer groups’ creative AI and ML projects. Although such a human-centered method is subjective, participants found that the exercise helped them to better describe and interpret dimensions of algorithmic creativity. This half-day workshop extends these methods and engages a broader arts and machine learning community to collaboratively define quantitative metrics assessing the creativity of algorithms and machines. This workshop is a first attempt to establish evaluation metrics for the area of creative AI.

We will publish our results after the workshop.

# Organizers

__Eunsu Kang__ is an artist, a researcher, and an educator who explores the intersection of art and machine learning, one of the core methods for building AI. Her works have been presented at conferences including ACM, ICMC, ISEA, SIGGRAPH Asia and NeurIPS. Kang earned her Ph.D. from DXARTS of the University of Washington, an MA from MAT, UCSB, and an MFA from Ewha Womans University. She was a tenured Associate Professor of New Media Art at the University of Akron and currently is a Visiting Professor of Art and Machine Learning at Carnegie Mellon University’s School of Computer Science. 

__Jean Oh__ is a faculty member at the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University. Her research addresses the creativity in decision making in the problem domains including self-driving cars, disaster response, healthcare, and arts. Her team’s work won the Best Paper Award at the 2018 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, and also the Best Cognitive Robotics Paper Award at the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation in 2015.  Jean received her Ph.D. in Language and Information Technologies at Carnegie Mellon University, M.S. in Computer Science at Columbia University, and B.S. in Biotechnology at Yonsei University.

__Robert Twomey__ is an artist and engineer exploring the poetic intersection of human and machine perception. He has presented his work at SIGGRAPH, the Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego, and his research has been supported by Microsoft, Amazon, and NVIDIA. Twomey received his BS from Yale with majors in Art and Biomedical Engineering, his MFA from UC San Diego, and his PhD in DXARTS from the University of Washington. Recently a postdoctoral with the Arthur C. Clarke Center for Human Imagination at UC San Diego, he is now an Assistant Professor with the [Johnny Carson Center for Emerging Media Arts](carsoncenter.unl.edu) at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.
